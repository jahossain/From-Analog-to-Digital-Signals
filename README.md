# From-Analog-to-Digital-Signals

This MATLAB project simulates the complete process of converting an analog signal into its digital representation. The workflow includes five key steps:

1. Generating a continuous-time sine wave,

2. Qsampling it at a chosen sampling frequency,

3. Quantizing the sampled values into discrete amplitude levels,

4. Encoding those quantized values into binary form, and

5. Forming the final digital bitstream.

The purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate how real-world signals from sensors (IoT devices, audio systems, etc.) are transformed into digital data that computers can store, process, and transmit. By experimenting with different sampling frequencies and quantization levels, the effects on signal quality and accuracy become clear, helping illustrate concepts such as Nyquist sampling and quantization resolution.
